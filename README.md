Each level solutions are composed of ONE Attacker Test, ONE Attacker Script and eventually ONE Attacker Smartcontract to deploy:
- Attacker Tests : test the solution locally
- Attacker Contract : deploy a optionnal smartcontract  
- Attacker Scripts : run the solution on the target nerwork (optionally after deploying the attacker smartcontract)

A generic template also provided for future levels.
